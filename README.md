# 🚀 Project Introduction

This project presents a clean and interactive web application, likely a static site built with modern web technologies. It focuses on delivering a user-friendly experience with a clear structure and dynamic elements. The inclusion of `_config.yml` suggests it leverages Jekyll for static site generation, offering an efficient way to manage content and deployment.

## ✨ Features

*   🎯 **Interactive User Interface**: Utilizes JavaScript for dynamic client-side interactions, enhancing user engagement.
*   🎨 **Stylized Presentation**: Features a custom design defined in `style.css` for a visually appealing experience.
*   📱 **Responsive Design**: Built to provide an optimal viewing experience across a wide range of devices (inferred from common web development practices).
*   📄 **Structured Content**: HTML5 provides a semantic and well-organized document structure.
*   🔧 **Static Site Generation**: Leverages Jekyll (indicated by `_config.yml`) for efficient content management and deployment.

## ⚙️ Workflow Overview

The project follows a standard web development workflow, enhanced by a static site generator:

*   📚 The `_config.yml` file configures the Jekyll environment, defining global settings and variables for site generation.
*   🌐 The `index.html` file serves as the main entry point, providing the foundational structure and content of the web page.
*   💅 Visual styling and layout are handled by `style.css`, ensuring a consistent and appealing look across the application.
*   ⚡ Client-side interactivity and dynamic behaviors are powered by `script.js`, adding engaging features for users.
*   🖼️ The final rendered output, incorporating all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, is depicted visually in the project's screenshot.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

### Installation steps

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <project-directory>
    ```
    (Replace `<repository-url>` and `<project-directory>` with actual values)

2.  **Install Jekyll (if not already installed)**:
    If you don't have Jekyll installed, follow the official Jekyll documentation for your operating system. Typically, this involves installing Ruby and then:
    ```bash
    gem install jekyll bundler
    bundle install # inside your project directory
    ```

### How to run the project

1.  **Serve with Jekyll**:
    Navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal and run the Jekyll server:
    ```bash
    bundle exec jekyll serve
    ```
    This will compile the site and serve it locally, usually accessible at `http://localhost:4000`.

2.  **Open Directly (Basic View)**:
    For a basic view without Jekyll's processing, you can simply open `index.html` in your web browser. Note that some Jekyll-specific features might not render correctly.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

*   **HTML5**: For structuring the web content.
*   **CSS3**: For styling and layout.
*   **JavaScript**: For dynamic client-side interactivity.
*   **Jekyll**: A static site generator, indicated by `_config.yml`, for building the website.
